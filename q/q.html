<h2>04/24/2020 Q-criterion and Spectrograms </h2>

<h3>Preliminary Visualization</h3>
<p> Iso-surfaces of Q-criterion, threshold set at 1. We see a lot of activity at the branch along the bottom as well as at the flow into the sac. Wanted to see what the pathlines look like at these regions </p>

<h3>Pathlines</h3>
<p> Can see what looks to be vortical flow in that same branch at the bottom. </p>

<h3>Spectrograms at different locations</h3>
<p> Took a sample of Q-criterion isosurfaces at timestep about 1/3 into the cycle and imported this into Dan's spectrogram tool to compare different regions of Q-iso surfaces to spectrograms. Some screenshots are below:  </p>

<p> For starters, the global spectrogram </p>

<p>The image below shows where I think the source of the harmonics in the spectrogram is.</p>
<img src = './q_and_spectro/c53/threshold_harmonic.png' width = "1280">

<p>We can see that moving slightly away from this region, there is a very different spectrogram</p>

<h3>Prototype of spectrogram & q-isosurfacce visualization</h3>
<p>It is apparent that different Q-isosurfaces have different spectral content. Using the paraview connectivity filter, we can identify groups of q-isosurfaces that are connected. For each group, we can take its points and compute their local spectrogram. Now, we need a way to visualzie some property of the spectrogram on the isosurfaces themselves to be able to show local variations. As a first pass at this, borrowing from the previous sonification project, I compute the sope of the interpolated power fall off of a spectrogram's FFT. The idea is that slopes closer to 0 indicate the flow is more broadband, and stteper slopes are more narrowband. The taking 36 timesteps of Q-criterion isosurfaces and roughly mapping them to the 36 timesteps in a spectrogram we can make the following pipeline: 1. compute q-criterion isosurfaces. 2. Get connected regions 3. For each connected region, take its points and compute their spectrogram. 4. Extract the spectrogram timestep that corresponds to the current frame and interpolate its slope. More broadband spectrograms will have a slope closer to zero.  </p>
