<h2>04/15/2020 Pathline Iterations</h2>
<br>

<h3>2 cycles each</h3>


<h3>Attempt 1 - 1D streamline, single colour. Inject 20 points every 5 timesteps, line length 2 timesteps </h3>
<p> Somewhat easy to see jet inflow but after that can't really get a sense of recirculation, as with some of the ribbons, can get a sense of the 'chaotic' nature of theflow but not much else. Particles are maybe too sparse, not long enough, or perhaps too thin. </p>

<h3>Attempt 2 - 1D streamline, single colour. Inject 20 points every 2 timesteps, line length 5 timesteps </h3>
<p> Slightly easier to make out impingement and some recirculation, but compared to the ribbon there are sitll some features that are not easy to identify. Perhaps this could be becasue there are no depth cues..  </p>

<h3>Attempt 3 - added width (2) to lines, single colour. Inject 20 points every 3 timesteps, line length is 1 timetep </h3>
<p> Thought using these small 'tubes' and adjusting the lighting/background might help with some depth cues, this is somewhat apparent in this animation but I think it is more difficult to discern flow patterns now, things seem to look more chaotic at a first glance. This might be because I did not track pathline tails, and/or maybe lines are too short? Though this does seem to give a stronger sense of the 'hostile' dynamics that are present in the sac (especially when the second cycle starts) that I don't think is evident from the longer lines or ribbons. I am starting to think maybe ribbons and longer path lengths are good for understanding more 'global' flow features, and smaller particles like this are better for communicating more local features (this seems to require really intently staring at one area and ignoring everything else) </p>

<h3>Attempt 4 - ray tracing 25 points per pixel, pathlines width 1, injected every 5 timestep, trail of 10 timesteps,1.5 lightscale </h3>
<p> This rendering style really helps to provide depth cues, it is much easier to get a sense of the flow because of this. Could have made the material of the aneurysm a bit less specular and slightly more opaque as it slightly distracts me from the flow. The texture is still a bit noisy, but a better render would have taken a lot more time, even this slightly over 24 hours, using OSPray in paraview, maybe could have been faster in blender. </p>

<h2> 04/14/2020 Trying out 2D pathlines</h2>
<br>

<h3> 2 cycles each</h3>

<h3>Attempt 1 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.1, pathline length 20 timestepsteps, reinjection every timestep, 50fps</h3>
<p>Ribbon seems too thin, and some of the colours are difficult to see clearly</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Attempt 2 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 10 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps</h3>
<p>Ribbons are easier to see, but maybe they are too short or there are not enough of them. Somewhat easier to distinguish recirculation patterns</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Attempt 3 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 1200 timesteps (one cycle), reinjection every timestep, 100fps</h3>
<p>This gets very dense and occluded, but maybe useful for looking at larger scale patterns, may be more useful if colour coded by outlet </p>

<h3>Attempt 4 - one color with 10 inject points, ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 20 timestepsteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps. Trying new orientation</h3>
<p>The new orientation helps to see what I think is a recirulation zone that is close to the right outlet. Not sure what the most anatomically correct view would be Maybe easier to see overall/bulk motion here because only one color is used. I think susing a single colour works better as well, but am curious to see how other colouring schemes (eg., by outlet) might look... In general still seems to be too 'busy' </p>

<h3>Attempt 5 - colored by inject point (3 points), ribbon width 0.3, pathline length 50 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps. </h3>
<p>Tried with less colours, still seems busy. Again, colour coding by inject point does not seem to help much? <br>

<h3>Attempt 6.1 - single colour with 4 inject points, ribbon width 0.3, pathline length 10 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, opacity 0.9, 100fps. </h3>
<p>I think this is the best one so far with respect to communicating the flow patterns. In general, still feels very busy but I think this gives me the best sense of the impingement and recirculaiton zones. </p>

<h3>Attempt 6.2 - same as above but coloured by inject point </h3>
<p> Comparing this to the previous video is a good example of a case where colour coding can be distracting. It is much more difficult to get a sense of the flow from this video even though all other parameters are identical.</p>

<h3>Attempt 6.3 - same as above but longer traces (100 timesteps) </h3>
<p>With the coloured injection points, the longer pathlines seem to help to get a beter sense of the flow, but I still think single coloured is the better of the two, but I have yet to try other colouring schemes with this..
