<h2> 04/14/2020 Trying out 2D pathlines</h2>
<br>

<h3>Attempt 1 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.1, pathline length 20 timestepsteps, reinjection every timestep, 50fps</h3>
<p>Ribbon seems too thin, and some of the colours are difficult to see clearly</p>

<h3>Attempt 2 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 10 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps</h3>
<p>Ribbons are easier to see, but maybe they are too short or there are not enough of them. Somewhat easier to distinguish recirculation patterns</p>

<h3>Attempt 3 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 1200 timesteps (one cycle), reinjection every timestep, 100fps</h3>
<p>This gets very dense and occluded, but maybe useful for looking at larger scale patterns, may be more useful if colour coded by outlet </p>

<h3>Attempt 4 - one color with 10 inject points, ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 20 timestepsteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps. Trying new orientation</h3>
<p>The new orientation helps to see what I think is a recirulation zone that is close to the right outlet. Not sure what the most anatomically correct view would be Maybe easier to see overall/bulk motion here because only one color is used. I think susing a single colour works better as well, but am curious to see how other colouring schemes (eg., by outlet) might look... In general still seems to be too 'busy' </p>

<h3>Attempt 5 - colored by inject point (3 points), ribbon width 0.3, pathline length 50 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps. </h3>
<p>Tried with less colours, still seems busy. Again, colour coding by inject point does not seem to help much? <br>

<h3>Attempt 6.1 - single colour with 4 inject points, ribbon width 0.3, pathline length 10 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, opacity 0.9, 100fps. </h3>
<p>I think this is the best one so far with respect to communicating the flow patterns. In general, still feels very busy but I think this gives me the best sense of the impingement and recirculaiton zones. </p>

<h3>Attempt 6.2 - same as above but coloured by inject point </h3>
<p> Comparing this to the previous video is a good example of a case where colour coding can be distracting. It is much more difficult to get a sense of the flow from this video even though all other parameters are identical.</p>

<h3>Attempt 6.3 - same as above but longer traces (100 timesteps) </h3>
<p>With the coloured injection points, the longer pathlines seem to help to get a beter sense of the flow, but I still think single coloured is the better of the two, but I have yet to try other colouring schemes with this..
