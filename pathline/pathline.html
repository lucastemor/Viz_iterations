<h2>04/24/2020 Color Coding by Outlet</h2>
<p> The old approach did not fully as the particle tracer in paraview deviated from the precomputed pathlines (even when inject points and frequency are identical). This new approach just manually animates the precomputed pathlines, and seems to work:

<h3>Attempt 1 - 2 cycles, inject 10 points every timestep, track for 40 timesteps</h3>

<h2>04/17/2020 Color Coding by Outlet (Not fully working)</h2>

<h3>Attempt 2 - 2 cycles, inject 10 points every timestep, track for 10 timesteps</h3>
<p> The tracking/labelling of each point is not perfect but seems to perfom okay in general (seems to break down the most during each cycle's peak).. Does not seem to handle continuously injecting points very well. Right now I am computing pathlines from a set of points and then recomputing them for animation so I think there might be some computational error between the two calculations which is causing incorrect labelling for some of the points. Going to try manually animaitng the original pathlines as a next step, but some visualizations using this method are shown below.  </p>

<h3>Attempt 3 - 2 cycles, inject 10 points every timestep, track for 20 timesteps, line width of 2</h3>
<p> Just playing around with some of the variables. It is quite clear to see the two distinct flow regions that eventually flow out of either outlet, but it is possible that other features of the flow are less clear in this representation. For example, it is difficult to get a sense of depth/recirculation of the flow going into the screen. This may because of the lighting scheme, perhaps less brightness/more shading/depth cues can help this. Furthermore, the mislabelling of some of the outflows is also misleading, will have to improve this.   </p>

<h3>Attempt 4 - 2 cycles, inject 10 points every timestep, track for 20 timesteps, ribbon width 0.2</h3>
<p> Same visualization as above jsut trying out this ribbon style representation from before. ... It is very apparent here that the tracking breaks down about 1/3 into the cycle (this animation only for one cycle). This representation not good until approach is refined.   </p>

<h3>Attempt 5 - Some static images of completely computed pathlines, 10 points injected every timestep over 2 cycles. </h3>

<p> These images are cross sections of the sac clipped with a plane parallel to the view of the screen. First one rendered normally (OpenGL) with line width = 1 and opacity = 0.2. We can see recirculation zone in the bottom left. We would expect there to be a second recirculation zone on the right side of the jet but this isn't visible here, perhaps because of the position of the clipping plane  </p>
<img src = './colouredOutlet/still1_opacity0p2_first.png' width = "1280">

<p> The three images below were rendered using OSPray in paraview and show the effect of varying line width. Each was generated with 100 samples per pixel. The first one shows line width of 0.1. The representation looks too dense. </p>
<img src = './colouredOutlet/still2_raycast_0p1width.png' width = "1280">

<p>Below is line width = 0.01. This representation is too sparse, it is difficult to see the recirculation zone as before</p>
<img src = './colouredOutlet/still3_raycast_0p01width.png' width = "1280">

<p>Below is line width = 0.05. This seems to be the best static representation, it shows the recirculation zone, and the two distinct regions, balancing occlusion and sparsity. Would like to try this with a better clip plane position that can show more about the recirculation on the right side. </p>

<h2>04/15/2020 Pathline Iterations</h2>
<br>

<h3>2 cycles each</h3>


<h3>Attempt 1 - 1D streamline, single colour. Inject 20 points every 5 timesteps, line length 2 timesteps </h3>
<p> Somewhat easy to see jet inflow but after that can't really get a sense of recirculation, as with some of the ribbons, can get a sense of the 'chaotic' nature of theflow but not much else. Particles are maybe too sparse, not long enough, or perhaps too thin. </p>

<h3>Attempt 2 - 1D streamline, single colour. Inject 20 points every 2 timesteps, line length 5 timesteps </h3>
<p> Slightly easier to make out impingement and some recirculation, but compared to the ribbon there are sitll some features that are not easy to identify. Perhaps this could be becasue there are no depth cues..  </p>

<h3>Attempt 3 - added width (2) to lines, single colour. Inject 20 points every 3 timesteps, line length is 1 timetep </h3>
<p> Thought using these small 'tubes' and adjusting the lighting/background might help with some depth cues, this is somewhat apparent in this animation but I think it is more difficult to discern flow patterns now, things seem to look more chaotic at a first glance. This might be because I did not track pathline tails, and/or maybe lines are too short? Though this does seem to give a stronger sense of the 'hostile' dynamics that are present in the sac (especially when the second cycle starts) that I don't think is evident from the longer lines or ribbons. I am starting to think maybe ribbons and longer path lengths are good for understanding more 'global' flow features, and smaller particles like this are better for communicating more local features (this seems to require really intently staring at one area and ignoring everything else) </p>

<h3>Attempt 4 - ray tracing 25 points per pixel, pathlines width 1, injected every 5 timestep, trail of 10 timesteps,1.5 lightscale </h3>
<p> This rendering style really helps to provide depth cues, it is much easier to get a sense of the flow because of this. Could have made the material of the aneurysm a bit less specular and slightly more opaque as it slightly distracts me from the flow. The texture is still a bit noisy, but a better render would have taken a lot more time, even this slightly over 24 hours, using OSPray in paraview, maybe could have been faster in blender. </p>

<h2> 04/14/2020 Trying out 2D pathlines</h2>
<br>

<h3> 2 cycles each</h3>

<h3>Attempt 1 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.1, pathline length 20 timestepsteps, reinjection every timestep, 50fps</h3>
<p>Ribbon seems too thin, and some of the colours are difficult to see clearly</p>

<h3>Attempt 2 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 10 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps</h3>
<p>Ribbons are easier to see, but maybe they are too short or there are not enough of them. Somewhat easier to distinguish recirculation patterns</p>

<h3>Attempt 3 - coloured by inject point (4 pts), ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 1200 timesteps (one cycle), reinjection every timestep, 100fps</h3>
<p>This gets very dense and occluded, but maybe useful for looking at larger scale patterns, may be more useful if colour coded by outlet </p>

<h3>Attempt 4 - one color with 10 inject points, ribbon width 0.2, pathline length 20 timestepsteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps. Trying new orientation</h3>
<p>The new orientation helps to see what I think is a recirulation zone that is close to the right outlet. Not sure what the most anatomically correct view would be Maybe easier to see overall/bulk motion here because only one color is used. I think susing a single colour works better as well, but am curious to see how other colouring schemes (eg., by outlet) might look... In general still seems to be too 'busy' </p>

<h3>Attempt 5 - colored by inject point (3 points), ribbon width 0.3, pathline length 50 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, 100fps. </h3>

<h3>Attempt 6.1 - single colour with 4 inject points, ribbon width 0.3, pathline length 10 timesteps, reinjection every timestep, opacity 0.9, 100fps. </h3>
<p>I think this is the best one so far with respect to communicating the flow patterns. In general, still feels very busy but I think this gives me the best sense of the impingement and recirculaiton zones. </p>

<h3>Attempt 6.2 - same as above but coloured by inject point </h3>
<p> Comparing this to the previous video is a good example of a case where colour coding can be distracting. It is much more difficult to get a sense of the flow from this video even though all other parameters are identical.</p>

<h3>Attempt 6.3 - same as above but longer traces (100 timesteps) </h3>
<p>With the coloured injection points, the longer pathlines seem to help to get a beter sense of the flow, but I still think single coloured is the better of the two, but I have yet to try other colouring schemes with this..
